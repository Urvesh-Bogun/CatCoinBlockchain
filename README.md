A simple Python implementation of a blockchain-like structure for managing transactions in a hypothetical cryptocurrency called CatCoin (CC).

This project demonstrates the basic structure of a blockchain, where each block contains:

A list of transactions.

The hash of the previous block.

Its own hash, computed using SHA-256.

The blockchain ensures data integrity by linking each block to the previous one via its hash.
